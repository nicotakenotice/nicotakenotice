## 👋 Hi, I'm Nico 
👨‍💻 A software developer with a bachelor's degree in CS attained at 🎓 [University of Padua](https://www.unipd.it/en/), currently living and working in 🗺️ Vicenza, Italy.

🧙 I'm mostly a front-end type of guy with a keen eye for sleek interfaces, but I also enjoy back-end development. I'm just terribly eager to get visual results of what I'm doing.

⬇️ Below you'll find me messing around with some of these languages/frameworks.

| 🔷 Languages | 💠 Frameworks |
| --- | --- |
| `.html` `.css` `.js` `.ts` | `Angular` `Svelte` |
| `.cpp` `.cs` | `Qt` `.NET` |
| `.sql` | |
